Inquiries relevant to Banyan should be directed to the contact pages on Banyan's website, [here](https://banyan.computer).

## Consulting policy

If you would like me personally to help you with something (usually: technical investment diligence, development work or technical advising), my rate is $300/hour.

I have limited capacity outside of my company and am selective about engagements. I can lower my rate if the work is interesting, likely to teach me new things, does something good for society, or involves equity in something promising.

If you're still interested, reach out on LinkedIn.

## Sales

Please do not contact me to try and sell me (or Banyan) things we don't need. I will sign you up for every marketing list I can find. And I might cry. That would be really weird for both of us.
