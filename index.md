## so glad you made it!

i am a founder, engineer, and researcher, currently living in NYC. i am a 26 year old American lady. i have a partner who i live and travel with and a big fluffy dog named alan turing.

i am the founder of a [company](https://banyan.computer). the website doesn't describe what we currently do very well, because it's from before a pivot.

my free-time activities include some research and freelance development for money and fun, and lots of hobbies (see my about page).
