I gave a talk about good design and game theory for a trustless CDN at the HTTP Gateways track of IPFS Thing in Brussels, Belgium.

The PPTX is [here](/assets/files/ipfs-cdn-incentives.pptx).

Check out the speaker notes.

Matt Stephenson from Pantera formalized some of the peer-to-peer game theory [here](https://gist.github.com/laudiacay/3e082a234e3424701b38f10ef174e720).

We haven't built this because it making money would depend on the demand side. Which currently doesn't exist. You have to get popular apps on (or built on) it. Good luck, nobody so far has succeeded, millions of venture capital dollars have gone into this hole.
