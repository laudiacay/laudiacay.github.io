We (Lev Stambler and I) wrote a cool little batched-private-defi-execution app for Ethereum with Lev Stambler for the Zuzalu ZK hackathon. 

The concept is like Tornado Cash but for swapping. It's built something like Penumbra minus the homomorphic shielding (thanks to Henry de Valence for input on this aspect of the design!), and it's also something like ZCash but with an added "swap" transaction type. 

It is not done, absolutely unaudited, do not use this. I mostly focused on the sequencer and the solidity, he wrote the Circom, and we co-created the design.
